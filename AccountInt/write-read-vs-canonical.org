#+title: Writing and reading vs canonical form

* Advantages of canonical form
+ It is easier to visualize the data struct.
+ The model is exactly the same of the real data struct, so it is easier to not make mistakes.
+ We use pattern match to destruct the terms, and it is easier to understand.

* Advantages of read and write form
+ It is a simpler model and works in more general cases such as arrays.
** Lazy approach addvantages
+ It is lazy, so it avoids unnecessary writing when it is not necessary.
+ It avoids branching.
** Not Lazy approach advantages
+ The model is more similar to the real program.
+ The canonical form of writing has a meaning in the definition.
  In the lazy approach, the sequence of writing has only a meaning after the reading.
+ Sometimes, it is necessary to read in the position to write on it (in case of matrix),
  so the lazy approach does not work or work poorly in this case.
